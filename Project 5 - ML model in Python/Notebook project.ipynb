    "# Project 5 - Machine Learning Model in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "Artificial intelligence has been with us for a long time, but it has never developed at such a dizzying pace as today. Its models accompany us at every step. Starting with assistants in phones and online stores who recommend applications or products to complex language models such as ChatGPT or Bard. This application is extremely wide, and the popularization of these models is due to the growing computing power to which we have access. Thanks to this, almost each of us can build such a model on our computer at home!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I would like to use a popular set of tools in the most popular programming language, Python, in order not only to better understand the relationship between the data used in previous projects, but also to use them to build a model that will allow predicting the grades obtained by gymnastics competitors!\n",
    "\n",
    "What are my goals for this project? We know that the final grade is the sum of two components - `DScore` and `EScore` minus the `Penalty`. Therefore, their correlation with the final grade will be clear, but perhaps we can indicate other variables, such as country of origin? We'll check it. Ultimately, I would like to build a model that will have practical applications, e.g. for coaches, and will allow them to determine training priorities by predicting their place in the ranking based on dependent variables! \n",
    "\n",
    "In order to understand this project, you should master at least the basics of awarding grades in gymnastics, which is why I am posting them below. (This is the same set of information you can find in [Project 3](https://github.com/Asturn15/Gymnastics-on-GitHub/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20MS%20Excel%20analysis))\n",

    "__`Difficult Score (D score)`__ - is a rating given to a gymnast for how difficult an exercise he performed. It consists of four special requirements for meeting which you can get _0.5_ points. These requirements are different for each instrument (Vault is an exception - there are no requirements here). In addition to the requirements, points are awarded for the 8 most difficult elements - for juniors, 10 for seniors. How do we know how many points each item is worth? These can be found in special tables in the [Code of Points](https://www.gymnastics.sport/publicdir/rules/files/en_%202022-2024%20MAG%20CoP.pdf). In short - the elements are classified into difficulty groups, from _A_ to _J_. Element _A_ of the group is worth _0.1_ points, element _B_ of the group is worth _0.2_ points, etc. At the end of the exercise, the judges evaluating the difficulty by listing all the elements and choose the most difficult ones - with the greatest benefit for the competitor. Some examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Backflip on Floor Exercise is _A_ group - worth _0.1_ points\n",
    "* Triple backflip on Floor Exercise is _H_ groups - worth _0.8_ points\n",
    "* Press to handstand on Parallel Bars is _A_ group - worth _0.1_ points\n",
    "* Double back flip dismnout from Parallel Bars is _C_ group - worth _0.3_ points\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the requirements on each of the devices is the landing of the appropriate difficulty - Group _C_ for juniors, and Group _D_ for seniors. If the players jump down a group lower, they will receive _0.3_ points for this requirement. All groups below do not meet this requirement. In addition, each device has its own special rules thanks to which the player can get a bonus, however, not wanting to complicate the topic, I will stop here. That's enough for us. I am also posting sample recordings on which you can see the valuation of the entire exercise => \n",
    "[Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQYf1AZqjsg&ab_channel=GymBestEdit)\n",
    "[Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EiAm__ymb0s&ab_channel=GymBestEdit)\n",
    "[Example 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCGHvQc3mbA&ab_channel=GymBestEdit)\n",
    "\n",
    "> As I mentioned earlier, the vault is an exception. Here, the coach reports before the start what jump his competitor will perform, and his score is read from the Code of Points. If he makes an easier jump, his score will be reduced accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`Execution Score (E score)`__ - is a mark for how correctly the competitor performed his exercise. This grade is set differently from that for difficulty. Each gymnast whose exercise consists of the minimum number of elements - _7_ for juniors, _9_ for seniors, receives __10_ points at the beginning. Points for errors made during the exercise are subtracted from this value.\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Small_ -  cost _0.1_ point\n",
    "* _Medium_ - cost _0.3_ point\n",
    "* _Large_ - cost _0.5_ point\n",
    "* _Fall_ - cost _1.0_ point\n",
    "\n",
    "What do we call errors? What is a big mistake and what is only a small one? In short - it's everything that deviates from the perfect performance. It will be easier to understand with specific examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Small hop (approximately - less than foot length) after landing - _small error_ - _0.1_ point\n",
    "* Hitting the apparatus during exercise - _medium error_ - _0.3_ point\n",
    "* Failure to withstand the strength element- _large error_ - _0.5_ point\n",
    "\n",
    "Why does the format of this number have 3 decimal places? As you can easily see, whether the jump is \"big\" or \"medium\" or \"small\" is a relative thing, that's why there are several E judges during the competition, and the score is their arithmetic mean. As always - it's better to see the examples, so as before, watch the videos => \n",
    "[Example 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EXCoDxnAbT8&ab_channel=calebfever)\n",
    "[Example 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PsotXyhe1Cg&ab_channel=GymBestEdit)\n",
    "[Example 3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u2_oOeYwgSo&ab_channel=GymBestEdit)\n",
    "\n",
    "__`Penalty`__ - Happiness is easier here. These are points deducted for breaking the rules included in the regulations, like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Too long exercise\n",
    "* Use of mattresses where prohibited\n",
    "* Exercise too short (too few elements)\n",
    "\n",
    "I intentionally don't give values here because there are a lot of conditions, and it's not that common again.\n",
    "\n",
    "__`Total Score`__ => (`DScore + EScore`) - `Penalty`\n",
    "\n",
    "> Looking at what directly affects the final grade, we notice that one of them can be \"easily\" increased, making our exercise more difficult (D score). The second of these ratings (E score) is a bit more problematic in this respect. Everyone who went for a short jog at least once experienced fatigue, and with it had to slow down. The same applies to gymnastics, so even the simplest exercises are never flawless.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why do we need to know this? Thanks to this knowledge, it will be easier for us to read the results of the competition. We'll have some idea of what's different between exercises that are, for example, 2.0 difficult score, or 1,000 execution score.\n",

Of course, for the purposes of the project, this division will be slightly simplified, but I think it will accurately reflect the essence of the matter.\n",

    "1. __Group 1__ - Western countries that rely on knowledge of biomechanics and physiology, which they use in their training processes, and well-equipped gyms provide them with excellent conditions for training.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. __Group 2__ - countries from the Eastern Bloc and southern Europe. This is where many coaches work with many years of experience gained in Soviet times, when gymnastics was extremely popular in the Eastern Bloc. They compensate for their lack of equipment in gyms with extensive experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. __Group 3__ - South American countries. In these countries, gymnastics is developing at a very fast pace, taking advantage of what is best in groups 1 and 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. __Group 4__ - Asians are exceptional in many ways and gymnastics is no different. This is largely due to multi-generational experience and fully equipped facilities that create great conditions for them\n",
    "\n",
    "5. __Group 5__ - Individual competitors from countries where gymnastics is not a popular sport.\n",
    "\n",
    "Of course, the proposed division will not fully solve our problem with the limited amount of data - especially for gymnasts from group 5, but for now it must be enough for us."
