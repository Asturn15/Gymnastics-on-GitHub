# Who am I ?

Hi, my name is __Michal__. I have been working as a sports gymnastics trainer for 8 years. Numbers are something that has always accompanied me. Tables, charts have never been just a set of lines and numbers, but what impressed me because they describe the reality that surrounds us. For this reason, I was a diligent student of mathematics, physics and computer science until the final year.

I started my studies in a seemingly unrelated field - physiotherapy. Passion for movement and training resulted in the fact that I tried to understand the most beautiful of sports - mens artistic gymnastics. Using my analytical skills and knowledge gained during my studies, I was able not only to understand the movement, but also to successfully teach it. This passion for movement, its understanding and hard work, I try to pass on to my charges with a smile. I also became a gymnastics referee at the national level. However, this work did not stop me from following the development of modern technology. Popular language models (Bard, Chat GPT), image generators (Midjourney, Firyfly) or other complex neural networks impressed me so much that I decided to try my skills in this field, using my basics acquired through many years of education.

## My beginnings

I started my journey with what I always liked i.e. data and their analysis. I got acquainted with the basic assumptions of data analysis as part of a course available on the Coursera platform from IBM, dedicated to this field. At the same time, I expanded my knowledge of mathematics and statistics using courses and academic materials. The next steps I take on this path are learning to use various tools thanks to which I will be able to acquire data, process and analyze it. After searching widely available course materials, getting to know the channels of people talking about the work of a data scientist and studying numerous analyzes on the kaggle platform, I have identified a set of tools that I want to master. Among them were:

* Microsoft Excel
* SQL
* Power BI
* R
* Python (Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit learn)

As always, the internet came to the rescue. I continued the IBM course that I started, which allowed me to master the basics of these tools in an orderly manner. Thanks to this, I learned to see the similarities and understand the differences, allowing me to decide which ones to use at a given moment. I deepened the particular issues that interested me by studying the materials attached to the course or those that I found on the Internet.

## Portfolio

Knowing is one thing, using it is quite another. Averages, tables and graphs may be pretty, but say nothing to whoever looks at them. To be valuable, they must answer the questions asked and solve very specific problems that we face on a daily basis. For this reason, I decided to use my experience as a coach and referee, as well as the acquired skills, to analyze the results of men's artistic gymnastics from 2022 in Poland, comparing them to those in the world. For this purpose, I created 6 projects using the tools mentioned earlier, which allow you to look at the problem of low results of the Polish national team in a broader way and find some solutions that can improve these situations.

A detailed description of each of the described projects can be found in the note attached to individual folders (Project 1, Project 2, etc.). There you will find the basic assumptions, the biggest challenges, weaknesses and thoughts on the use of this particular tool. Below, the planned roadmap for the analysis results of men's artistic gymnastics in 2022.

__**[PROJECT 1](https://github.com/Asturn15/Gymnastics-on-GitHub/tree/main/Project%201%20-%20Data)**__ - __Data__ - extraction, cleaning and saving.

__**[PROJECT 2](https://github.com/Asturn15/Gymnastics-on-GitHub/tree/main/Project%202%20-%20SQL%20data%20base%20%26%20query)**__ - __SQL database__ - Database in SQL, containing results from all gymnastics competitions taking place in Poland in 2022.

__**[PROJECT 3](https://github.com/Asturn15/Gymnastics-on-GitHub/tree/main/Project%203%20-%20MS%20Excel%20analysis)**__ - __Microsoft Excel__ - Analysis of results from Poland using the most popular tool.

### Projects in progress, will be update in the future =>

>[PROJECT 4] - Power BI - An interactive dashboard that allows you to compare the results of competitions in Poland with those from the world.
>
>[PROJECT 5] - Python - An interactive dashboard using a programming language.
>
>[PROJECT 6] - ML model in Python - A simple model that allows you to predict gymnasts score.

### At the end of each project you will find three tabs

---

__+++ PROS +++__ where it indicates the strengths of the solutions I have used and the actions I have taken!

__--- CONS ---__ weaknesses, because every coin has two sides.

__??? SOLUTIONS ???__ the solutions I propose for the defects found.

### I invite you on a fascinating journey through the world of gymnastics!</span>
